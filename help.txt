This program is a game in which you interact with moving balls and shoot balls and they move to it other balls.
It also stores data from games into files like highest score, score of winner, score of looser, who is winner and who
is looser and the date the game was played. Unfortunately in this program the game has not been implemented. You can only
see the panel of the game but no interaction will happen if attempted. The only interaction here is with the Java menu on
the top and buttons on every other window.

***It is important to note that preliminary information has been added to files to ensure the program runs correctly.
There are 2 usernames that have been added Which in this case are “Fernando” and “Luis” they also have passwords which
are “1111” and “2222” respectively. This is for the user database p3 file. The other data in this file is the current
highest score of each one of them and the date it was achieved. if the score is 0 then the date corresponds to the date
when the user was created.

The historyP3 file contains one entry of one game that was played. this contains the winner, the looser, 
the score of each one respectively and the date which this game was played. In This implementation a game played is
simulated by entering information in a window named Game emulator. entering the correct information will add an entry 
to the history file.The current players file contains the currently selected players that will be used to run the simulation
of the game and the only players that can be selected in the game emulator.
please not that opening many windows may cause the program to freeze in which case it is advised to relaunch the program
